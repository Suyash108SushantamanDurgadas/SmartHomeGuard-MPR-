# Smart Home Guard – MPR Semester 5

### 🧩 Problem Statement
Design a **Smart Home Guard System** capable of detecting unauthorized entry and alerting the owner in real-time.

### 💻 Overview
This project is a **simulation-based prototype** developed on **ESP32 using Wokwi**, later adapted for **STM32 hardware**.  
It detects door and motion activity, differentiates between normal and unauthorized entries, and can be manually reset if the owner recognizes a known visitor.

### ⚙️ Features
- PIR-based motion detection  
- Custom logic circuit for door simulation  
- Reset mechanism to avoid false intruder alerts  
- Real-time state transition management  
- Designed using a state machine architecture

### 🧠 Team
- **Devesh Shelatkar**  
- **Priyanka Vaidya**  
- **Suyash Shirsat**

### 📘 Notes
This simulation represents the early **system design phase** of our MPR project before hardware implementation on STM32.
